This lab is based on efforts of Philippe Thomas, IBM available at https://github.com/phthom/cp4a, tailored to our local needs.

##  Introduction

During this lab we are going to connect to an **OpenShift** Cluster thru the CLI. Then we will deploy a sample application.

Be sure that you have your **labuser**xx userID with xx representing a number from 00 to 99. You also have been set a password associated to labuserxx. 

Don't use someone else userID except if the instructor ask you to do so. 





## 1 - Connect to your OpenShift Cluster

Connect to the lab27 server provided by IBM using server name, port number, username and password. 

``ssh -p <PORT> root@<Your IP Address:port``

or use any other SSH client (like putty)



Be sure you also have opened a terminal or a commande line window and that you are connected:

```shell
oc login https://master.x.cloudpak.site:8443
```

Then enter your Openshift Cluster Account credentials (userID and password). 

Be sure you are working on your **project** by typing the following command:

```bash
oc status
```



## 2 - Starting a basic application

For this exercise, we will use the CLI and then the OpenShift web console.

We already have a basic node.js application that you can see here (thanks to sclorg):

<https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex>

Create a new instance Node.js application based on this GitHub example **(change xx with you number)**

```bash
oc new-app https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex -l name=myapp<xx>
```

After a few seconds:

```bash
[labuser01@master ~]$ oc new-app https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex -l name=myapp01
--> Found image 0d01232 (4 months old) in image stream "openshift/nodejs" under tag "10" for "nodejs"

    Node.js 10.16.3 
    --------------- 
    Node.js 10.16.3 available as a container is a base platform for building and running various Node.js 10.16.3 applications and frameworks. Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

    Tags: builder, nodejs, nodejs-10.16.3

    * The source repository appears to match: nodejs
    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "nodejs-ex:latest"
      * Use 'start-build' to trigger a new build
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "nodejs-ex"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "nodejs-ex"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "nodejs-ex"

--> Creating resources with label name=myapp01 ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "nodejs-ex" created
    buildconfig.build.openshift.io "nodejs-ex" created
    deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "nodejs-ex" created
    service "nodejs-ex" created
--> Success
    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/nodejs-ex' to track its progress.
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose svc/nodejs-ex' 
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.

```



For that exercise, we just provide the code (the server.js file in the GitHub and some config files). 

> You can note that OpenShift if going to find itself that the provided code is Node.JS and then find a version 10 that can match this code. Then an image stream is built with the name **nodejs-ex** and stored in the registry. Then after the build, a deployment is done and the application is running with success.  



Track the build log until the app is built and deployed:

```bash
oc logs -f bc/nodejs-ex
```

Results:

```bash
oc logs -f bc/nodejs-ex

If you are familiar with Git, Docker and Kubernetes, you will notice several activities:

- a clone of the github repo 
- npm (because it is a Node.js source) is used to solve the lib dependencies. 
- Finally a docker container image is stored in the OpenShift registry (push)

To check that your application is running:

```bash
oc get pods
```

Results:

```bash
oc get pods            
NAME                READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
nodejs-ex-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          14m
nodejs-ex-1-cwltn   1/1       Running     0          13m
```

Please note that in Openshift You may use the kubectl command as well:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Results:

```bash
oc get pods            
NAME                READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
nodejs-ex-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          14m
nodejs-ex-1-cwltn   1/1       Running     0          13m
```

You will notice that one pod (job) has been completed for the build stage.

The other pod is still running (1/1) and this is our Node.JS application.

To make this application visible to the world, you should create a **route**. If you are familiar with Kubernetes, a route is very close concept of an ingress with the association of a DNS. 

In order to access the service from outside, we have to expose a route to the service:

```
oc expose svc/nodejs-ex
```

Result:

```bash
# oc expose svc/nodejs-ex
route.route.openshift.io/nodejs-ex exposed
```

But you don't know the route url yet - so let's check it with 

```
oc get route
```

 result:

```
[labuser01@master ~]$ oc get route
NAME               HOST/PORT                                         PATH      SERVICES           PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
nodejs-ex          nodejs-ex-labproj01.apps.x.cloudpak.site                    nodejs-ex          8080-tcp                 None

```

Now you get the url. Sample results:

``` 
nodejs-ex-labproj01.apps.x.cloudpak.site
```

You can notice the following :

- the url contains the project name 

  



Copy the url and get access to this new application inside Your VNC client :

Example:

![image-20191012135233812](images/image-20191012135233812-0881153.png)





## 3 - OpenShift Web Console

Get back to Your VNC client and go to the OpenShift Web Console (use your credentials if necessary)

![image-20191012141202613](images/image-20191012141202613-0882322.png)



On the right side, click on the blue link : **labproj<xx>**

![image-20191012141253852](images/image-20191012141253852-0882373.png)



You will switch from the `Service Catalog` to the `Application Console` 

![image-20191012140139136](images/image-20191012140139136-0881699.png)

to the `Application Console` 

![image-20191012140049135](images/image-20191012140049135-0881649.png)

This will show the new created application:

![1-OpenShift-Lab.assets/image-20200107095718881.png](1-OpenShift-Lab.assets/image-20200107095718881.png)

> The name of your application, the number of pod, the application URL link ...



Click on the `nodejs-ex, #1` blue link, then you will see some more details on the application: 

![image-20191012140537676](images/image-20191012140537676-0881937.png)



Walk thru all the buttons : 

![image-20191012141505750](images/image-20191012141505750-0882505.png)

## 

On the left side, click on **Pods**:

![image-20191012140923841](images/image-20191012140923841-0882163.png)



Click on the **running** Pod:

![image-20191012141622463](images/image-20191012141622463-0882582.png)

You will get this page:

![1-OpenShift-Lab.assets/image-20200107095905478.png](1-OpenShift-Lab.assets/image-20200107095905478.png)

Walk thru the different links to understand this application:

![image-20191012141800412](images/image-20191012141800412-0882680.png)

Like for example the logs:

![image-20191012141837264](images/image-20191012141837264-0882717.png)



Now, on the left part of the screen, click on `deployments`

![image-20191012142416925](images/image-20191012142416925-0883056.png)



Then click on the blue link `nodes-ex`

![image-20191012142541243](images/image-20191012142541243-0883141.png)

Click on the Actions button:

![image-20191012142706939](images/image-20191012142706939-0883227.png)

Then click on `Edit YAML`to look at the kubernetes resource definition:

![image-20191012142755397](images/image-20191012142755397-0883275.png)

 You will recognize the definition deploymentconfig, similar to Kubernetes deployment. 

Finally from the left side of the screen, click on `routes`

![image-20191012143052666](images/image-20191012143052666-0883452.png)

And you will see the route definition for that deployment: 

![image-20191012143150770](images/image-20191012143150770-0883510.png)

Open Your route (**nodejs-ex**), than click on "**Actions**" -> "**Edit Yaml**" to see the route definition

![image-20191012143231692](images/image-20191012143231692-0883551.png)

 Click "**Cancel**"

## 4 - Monitoring your application

To learn about monitoring of your application, on the left pane, click on the `Monitoring`icon:

![image-20191012145519383](images/image-20191012145519383-0884919.png)

You should see all the resources involved into your application in the cluster:

![image-20191012145611519](images/image-20191012145611519-0884971.png)

Walk thru some itmes like Pods or Builds where you can see some of the previous pages in this lab.

Go to Deployments (nodes-ex) and open the #1

![image-20191012145944647](images/image-20191012145944647-0885184.png)

Finally, increase the number of pods (**not too much** - 2). There is a limit set on the number of pods running in our system.

![image-20191012150046190](images/image-20191012150046190-0885246.png)

And after a while, you will see 2 active pods:

![image-20191012150140360](images/image-20191012150140360-0885300.png)

And at the bottom of the page:

![image-20191012150231361](images/image-20191012150231361-0885351.png)

This mens that now 2 pods are serving the requests. 

Now click on one of these new pods and you should a page like this one:

![image-20191012152905816](images/image-20191012152905816-0886945.png) 

Let's try a crazy experience and kill this pod ! click on the action button and select `delete`

![image-20191012153102475](images/image-20191012153102475-0887062.png)

The following popup window will appear:

![image-20191012153151649](images/image-20191012153151649-0887111.png)

Click on `Delete` and you should see breifly your pod terminating.

![image-20191012153249281](images/image-20191012153249281-0887169.png)



A new pod is automatically started !!! Because the number of replicaset has been defined to **2** , even if a pod is crashing, it will be replace automatically by a new one. 

![image-20191012153424224](images/image-20191012153424224-0887264.png)

## 5 - Clean the application

Clean the system - delete the application created.

The system has created a few comonents. As our resources are limited, before we will start fith further labs we need to delete the application created.

### 1. Clean the deployment

Select "**Applications**" -> "**Deployments**" from the web console menu on the left.

Click on the application that You have created:

![1-OpenShift-Lab.assets/image-20200107100359449.png](1-OpenShift-Lab.assets/image-20200107100359449.png)



From the **"Actions"** select "**Delete**". Confirm with "**Delete**" again.

## 



## Conclusion

You successfully installed and used the oc CLI and the OpenShift web console thru the installation of a typical Node.JS application (from Github). 

You noticed the following details:

- easy to access the OpenShift web console
- easy to build and deploy the application, the container, the pod.
- easy to scale up and down 
- automatic healing

You also noticed the difference between Kubernetes and OpenShift like 

- the route concept
- the wildcard DNS utilization
- the image stream and S2I concepts to build the docker image

**Congrats**
